## Summary: Your Tasks Only

These require your input (decisions) or your setup (infra):

1. **Decide on dedicated sending infrastructure pricing** — add-on $X/month for PitchIQ-managed.
2. **Set up dedicated sending domain infrastructure** — Cloudflare Email Routing, per-user subdomains.
3. **Build inbound reply detection** — Cloudflare Email Routing → webhook; we’ll add the webhook endpoint.
4. **Define follow-up copy templates and tone options** — write content; we wire into UI.
5. **Define scoring criteria per vertical** — media, social, VC scoring rules.
6. **Decide public rollout timing per vertical** — when to gate/ungate each.

## Coding Plan (What We’re Implementing)

1. Done: `follow_ups` table — run `supabase/follow-ups-schema.sql`
2. Done: Sequence config UI — Settings → Follow-up sequences
3. Done: Click tracking — `/api/track/click`; links in emails wrapped automatically
4. Done: Dashboard/pitches — Upgrade prompt, opened/clicked/follow-up badges on rows
5. Done: Stripe tiers + usage metering — `lib/billing.ts`; run `supabase/billing-tiers.sql`
6. Deferred: Vertical DB integrations (needs API keys, scoring criteria)

**Also run:** `supabase/click-tracking.sql`
